One project I had to do for my tennis team was to make a advertising video to encourage high school freshmen and sophmores to join the tennis team. The goal was to make a short and simple video for it to be uploaded onto the morning high school news to classrooms who watch it in the morning. The time took to plan and film took about 2 months to plan, schedule days to film it, and to edit. 

One struggle would have to be scheduling a few days where the boys team can come early to the tennis courts to film mainly because at least 10 boys would have to agree to help out film in their free time which can cause a lot of scheduling conflict. Another issue was time and resources since I was limited to editing only during my digital media class time and after school giving me only certain amount of time to work on the project. 

The skills that I have learned from this project was time management, scheduling, video productivity, pre-planning, and editing. It has taught me time management since i am only given 1-2 months to upload the video before break starts. Scheduling and pre-planning is very important as it helps layout the production day and what the final product could look like based off of the film that could be produced on scheduling and when everyone's available. Video productivity and editing is implemented since it helps strengthen my knowledge on learning how cameras work along with using an editing software called Adobe Premiere Pro.  

The image above is one of the shots of my video. I unfortunately cannot show the video since I would have to request permission from 10+ people in this video to show this video specifically.
