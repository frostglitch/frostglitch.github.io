In my free time, I have decided to make a house in a game called "Welcome to Bloxburg". The game "Welcome to Bloxburg" is heavily inspired by the game "The sims" where you have to take care of your character while also make a house at the same time. The main focus was to make a house for my character to satisfy my characters needs and give him shelter. The amount of time put into this project took quite a while since it was done in my own free time. 

This house project was done by myself and has taught me skills that can be applied in the future. Some skills that this house project has taught me are Pre-planning and Precision. These two skills can be applied in both real life and in Computer Science. Pre-planning is used to plan out code beforehand like pseudocodes similarly to how drawing blueprints and houseplans are used to draw out an idea of how the house will look like. Precision can be used to carefully code each line with accuracy similar to placing furnitures, spacing certain areas out, and placing walls for a house

If you want a house tour on how it looks, here is the link to the [House tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhYZW8EyqE&feature=youtu.be).
