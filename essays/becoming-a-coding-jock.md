## Intro

Jock is defined in the US as a physical athlete or someone who plays a sport and is usually not too interested in the property of intelligence. But what it actually means is "an enthusiast or participant in a specified activity". In a way everyone is a jock at something but for me I am aspired to be a coding jock. The two words is quite ironic since coding has almost nothing to do with physical activity except with moving the fingers.

## Programming languages as a sport

Learning javascript was like trying out a specific sport for the first time. Touching on a new sport or area of interest is all brand new but just like getting into exercise for the first time, there is some pain into "getting into shape". Similar to learning a new coding language, there are some new things to learn and some struggles to go through. There were at first similar aspects from java/C like arrays, how they do certain aspects of math stay the same, and they still have iteration like for and while loops. But there were new ways on how they did code like destructuring and new keywords like let and var. I think javascript is a good language to have as a software engineer. It allows new different ways on problem-solving that could hypothetically be used in other aspects in life/coding languages.

## Workout regiment

Athletic software engineering ties in quite funny with this topic since it's about the experience of being a "coding jock". I find these Workout Of the Day(WOD) to be quite useful. It helps workout the brain and improve the performance of our athleticsim in coding. I find them a bit stressful but also quite fun because it enables the person to code on their feet while also engaging and getting to know one another at the same time.
