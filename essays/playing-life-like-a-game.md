## Backstory

My main drive on learning software engineering is to learn how to be a game developer or to go into game design. As a kid I always grew up playing a lot of video games. Many people choose different ways to experience or "play" life. I see different aspects in life that can be similar to video games like leveling up and improving yourself, gaining experience in a certain skill, and socializing with one another. In a way life is like a video game, many obstacles and challenges in life but you gain a lot of "experience points" in that certain part of your life. 

## Interests

My interests in software engineering mainly revolves around game development and game design. I would like to explore how games work and how video games are made. I unfortunately do not have as much experience in coding languages like javascript but I would love to learn how. I believe the more adept I am at a certain coding language, the easier it will be to learn others like transitioning from learning how to play one video game to the next.

## Future wishes

The skills and experiences I hope to recieve in the future is learning how to make a professional persona and to learn how to design a user interface. Having a professional persona is very useful to have when applying to new jobs. It allows different interviewers and professionals to read your persona and get to know you as a person and as a worker. Designing a user interface also sounds intriguing to learn. A lot of video games have user interfaces that the player sees so it would be nice to have a grasp on coding a user interface.
