## Completing the software engineering hike

<img src="../images/hike.png">

The hike up software engineering was quite the journey. As I reach the top of the hike and see the nice view of my progress, I've learned a lot about how software engineering works. Some concepts of the journey I learned were coding standards and agile project management. There are many concepts that I have learned on the hike up towards software engineering but out of all the concepts, these two stick out. 

## Messy anti-patterns up ahead

When first going up the hike, there are certain obstacles to be wary of. Each obstacle can vary from steepness of difficulty, tedious bugs, different paths of solutions to take, and more. These can be quite tedious to handle similarly to handling messy methods in coding. If not careful on handling them, it can lead to more troubles, loss on where to advance, and frustration in some occasions. It's best to learn how to handle different obstacles like bringing a map/equipment on the go or in coding terms, ensuring quality while removing common solutions that do more harm than good or "anti-patterns" in the system. This type of concept is called coding standards and it can be similar to other applications in life like having certain house standards and following the rules of living in the house. If these standards are not followed in application, it can lead to difficulty in handling/finding the problem.

## Hike milestones

Each hike may seem big or long as its a long distance from point A to point B. But as you see the different checkpoints and reach each one of them, it gets easier to do similar to a project where you reach each milestone chunk of it. In a way, the road from point A to B in a hike is like doing a project from start to finish. For example, in my group project we had to create a website for 1 month so we subdivided it by 3 milestones which were split into issues that each member handled. As we all finished an issue at our own pace, the hike up to finishing the website slowly came closer to where we all finished the website. With communication and issue assignments, we were able to polish up a website that looks nicely done for users to use. This concept we practiced is Agile Project Management where we take a big project and split it among the team while working on each issue so the project may be completed. It's just like taking a big hike and splitting it into smaller checkpoints so the road up the hike does not seem as intimidating.

## Looking back

After we finished looking at the view of the hike to software engineering, we went back down and viewed what we learned. We learned coding standards which is similar to learning how to be tidy and organized. We also learned agile project management which shows us how to manage our time wisely while teaching the importance of teamwork. The concept of agile project management can be used in other projects working with people. In a way, these concepts can also apply to real life whether it would be cleaning up our room or working as a team in a game.
