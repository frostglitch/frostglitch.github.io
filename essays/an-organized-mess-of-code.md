## Intro

My english teacher once told me and my classmates on how he is a messy person yet he has a system on where things are. If one thing were to be moved from his mess, he would not know where that specific thing is since his mind is already trained on finding that specific item in that specific area. It is his mess of course but in a way it was his organized system of finding stuff around his house/workplace. In a way coding is like a messy bunch of numbers and letters on a screen but in an systematic way where every character and number is there for a reason.

## Scanning the heap

When lines of code is seen by a person with no coding knowledge, they may see it as a bunch of characters and numbers with no idea on what it's supposed to do or how it runs. When regular coders see it, we have a general idea on what they are trying to do but in order to do that, we would need coding standards. Even though it can be seen as a mess, we need a system or a middle ground on how the characters and numbers should be organized in our code. Coding standards in a way is like learning grammar and structure of different languages like english, without grammar or structure no one's going to know what one peer is saying to the other. So what could help us refine our "grammar" in coding? That would be with the help of a tool called an Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short.

## Traversing a mess with an IDE

One example of an IDE is a program called IntelliJ. IntelliJ helps with code formatting and allows software developers on making their code a bit easier to read. My thoughts on IntelliJ is both tiring at first but then useful in the long run. It's tiring at first mainly because the program gives formatting errors over small repeated things like "newline needed at end of code" and "this is never re-assigned, change it to a const instead". But overtime as we do those habits with repitition, it gets to where IntelliJ warns of those specific errors and it allows us to clean up our code on habit without a program telling us to do so. It can be carried over to other programming languages so it is much easier for other programmers/software developers to look at with some minor tweaks here and there depending on the language/IDE. 

## Conclusion

I believe that coding standards can help learn a programming language. Being able to learn the coding standards and how to format your code can allow other programmers to traverse through your code or "mess of characters and numbers" at a much more efficent rate.
